This workshop aims to bring together people from different areas and 
backgrounds in data mining and machine learning that have a common 
interest in energy <strong>efficiency</strong>, <strong>sustainability</strong>, and <strong>edge computing</strong>.<br />
<br />
For the past years, the main concern in machine learning had been to 
create highly accurate models, without considering the high computational 
requirements involved. This has lead to a scenario where most of the 
machine learning prediction is done in the cloud, incurring in security 
concerns and increased latency.<br />
<br />
However, there is an increasing trend in machine learning which focuses 
on building models that are able to run in the edge. For instance, Google 
has released the first speech recognition model running directly on the device, 
improving latency and reducing energy consumed by the network connectivity. 
Another example is TensorFlowLite, a powerful tool to deploy models on mobile 
and IoT devices.<br />
<br />
The goal with this workshop is to promote green machine learning even further, 
by creating a half-day workshop where researchers in different machine 
learning and data mining areas can bring together their ideas, present them 
in front of a heterogeneous crowd, and have interesting debates on how to 
advance machine learning into a more scalable future. This edition includes 
also applications of machine learning in areas re- lated to environmental data 
science and climate change, to address the needs of a more sustainable machine 
learning from a broader perspective.<br />
