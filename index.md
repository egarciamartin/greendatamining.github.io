**September 10-14, 2018 - Dublin, Ireland**
<hr><br />

This workshop aims to bring together people from many different fields
in machine learning and data mining that have a common interest in
energy efficiency, energy aware computing, hardware accelerators,
and embedded systems.<br />
<br />
These fields include, but are not limited to: deep learning,
big data, Internet of Things (IoT), large-scale computing,
stream mining, and distributed machine learning.<br />
<br />
The goal is to provide a venue for researchers to present their work,
exchange ideas, and discuss challenges related to energy-efficiency 
in machine learning, data mining, and supporting hardware platforms, 
and algorithms.
We accept original work, already completed, or in progress.
Position papers are also considered.
