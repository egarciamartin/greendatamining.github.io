## Green Data Mining
3rd International Workshop on Energy Efficient Scalable Data Mining and Machine Learning  
Co-located with ECML-PKDD 2020.
Conference Dates: September 14-18, 2020
Workshop Date: September 14, 2020 Ghent, Belgium (preliminary)
Website: [greendatamining.github.io](https://greendatamining.github.io)    


## Scope

This workshop aims to bring together people from different areas and backgrounds in data mining and machine learning that have a common interest in scalability, edge computing, and energy efficiency.
These fields include, but are not limited to: deep learning, Internet of Things (IoT), scalable machine learning, systems for machine learning, information retrieval systems, and stream mining.
The goal is to provide a venue where researchers with heterogeneous backgrounds can debate and discuss challenges related to building energy efficient machine learning algorithms, systems, and hardware platforms.  

We accept original work, already completed, or in progress. Position papers also welcomed.  
**All accepted papers will be published in ECML-PKDD 2020 Workshop proceedings.**
