To submit a paper:

 * Create an account and Log in to conference CMT submission site.
Please note that user accounts in each CMT conference are independent of other conferences,
so you will need to create a new account.

 * Complete the submission form by providing title, authors, one primary subject area,
any number of secondary subject areas and a short abstract. The manuscript must be uploaded in pdf format.

Before completing the submission, please make sure you have specified all your conflicts of interest.

## Paper Format

Overlength papers will be rejected without review (papers with smaller page margins
and font sizes than specified in the author instructions and set in the style files will
also be treated as overlength).

## Reviewing Process
The review process is single-blind (authors identities known to reviewers).
Submissions will be evaluated on the basis of technical quality, novelty, potential impact, and clarity.
